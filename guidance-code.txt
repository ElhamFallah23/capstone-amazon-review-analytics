# Terraform Commands Cheat Sheet

## 1. terraform init
Initializes the Terraform working directory by downloading the required provider plugins and setting up the backend (e.g., S3 for remote state). This must be run once before any other commands.

## 2. terraform fmt
Automatically formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical format.

## 3. terraform validate
Validates the Terraform configuration files for syntax and internal consistency, without accessing any remote services.

## 4. terraform plan
Creates an execution plan showing what actions Terraform will take to change the infrastructure to match the configuration.

## 5. terraform apply
Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. You will be prompted for approval unless `-auto-approve` is specified.

## 6. terraform destroy
Destroys all resources managed by Terraform that are defined in the configuration.

## 7. terraform show
Displays the current state or a saved plan file in a human-readable format.

## 8. terraform output
Displays the values of output variables defined in the configuration.

## 9. terraform state list
Lists all resources tracked in the current state file.

## 10. terraform state show <resource>
Shows attributes of a specific resource in the Terraform state.

## 11. terraform taint <resource>
Manually marks a resource for recreation on the next apply.

## 12. terraform untaint <resource>
Removes the taint from a resource, canceling the recreation action.

## 13. terraform workspace list
Lists all available workspaces.

## 14. terraform workspace new <name>
Creates a new workspace with the given name.

## 15. terraform workspace select <name>
Selects an existing workspace to switch context.

## 16. terraform import <address> <id>
Imports an existing resource into Terraform state so it can be managed.

## 17. terraform refresh
Updates the state file with the real infrastructure (used to detect drift).

## 18. terraform output -json
Useful for automation, this outputs variables in machine-readable JSON format.

# Note:
- Always use `terraform init` after modifying provider versions or backend settings.
- For production environments, always review the `plan` before `apply`.
- Remote backends (like S3 + DynamoDB) should be used for team collaboration and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🔹 GitHub Actions Related

### Workflow Files
Workflows live inside `.github/workflows/` and are written in YAML.

### 1. Trigger by Push
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### 2. Trigger by Pull Request
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
```

### 3. Define Jobs and Steps
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
```

### 4. Set Environment for Manual Approval
```yaml
environment:
  name: dev-approve
  url: https://your-env-link
```

### 5. Use Secrets from GitHub
```yaml
env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  AWS_ROLE_ARN: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
```

### 6. Terraform in GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Setup Terraform
  uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

- name: Terraform Init
  run: terraform init

- name: Terraform Plan
  run: terraform plan

- name: Terraform Apply
  run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

# ✅ Best Practice:
- Use separate workflows for plan and apply.
- Use manual approval for apply in production.
- Protect main branch using environments and required reviewers.
